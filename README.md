# Cache_management_Processor
This is a course project of Computer archiecture and Organistation.
This is an implementation of a direct map cache managed processor using logisim tool, which fetches and executes the instructions fed as program. Testing of the processor is made seperately fo reach of the module and the results were as expected.


To run the circuit file logisim should be downloaded on the computer, you can get it [here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)
Open the proc.circ file that contains the main circuitary of the processor and the modules those are required for the main implementation.

For further understanding you can refer to the Report.pdf file.
